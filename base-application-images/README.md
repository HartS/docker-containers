# Base images for applications

Here can be found some images based on openSUSE-42.2, each image is meant to
ship a single application. 

Note that all them are a base image of openSUSE-42.2 plus the application
they ship. They are not layered or derived images of openSUSE-42.2.

All images are temporary until KIWI is not capable to build derived images.
